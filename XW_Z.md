* All the participants were recruited by advertisement and supported throughout the testing procedures in a specialist neuropsychological research facility at Xuanwu Hospital, Beijing, China. Patients and informants (usually a family member) were interviewed clinically by a senior psychiatrist (X. Zhang). Written consent forms were obtained from all subjects or their legal guardians (usually a family member). The study was approved by the ethics committee of Xuanwu Hospital. AD subjects were diagnosed using standard operationalised criteria (DSM-IVR [American Psychiatric Association, 1994] and NINCDS-ADRDA (<a href="https://github.com/YongLiuLab/MCADI/wiki/ref#ref14">McKhann</a> et al., 1984)]). 

* Inclusion criteria for AD diagnosis included the following: Severity of dementia was assessed using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale (<a href="https://github.com/YongLiuLab/MCADI/wiki/ref#ref2">Morris</a>, 1993). Patients with a diagnosis of AD and CDR score of 1 were classified as mild AD; patients with a CDR score of 2 or 3 were diagnosed as severe AD. 

* Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was diagnosed according to standard criteria (<a href="https://github.com/YongLiuLab/MCADI/wiki/ref#refadd1">Petersen</a> et al., 1999, <a href="https://github.com/YongLiuLab/MCADI/wiki/ref#ref15">Petersen</a> et al., 2001, <a href="https://github.com/YongLiuLab/MCADI/wiki/ref#ref16">Choo</a> et al., 2007), which included subjective memory loss with objective evidence of memory impairment in the context of normal or near-normal performance on other domains of cognitive functioning; minimal impairment of activities of daily living; and a CDR score of 0.5. Normal volunteers have a CDR score of 0. 

* All participants satisfied the following inclusion criteria:
  1. no history of an affective disorder within one month prior to assessment;
  1. normal vision and audition;
  1. able to cooperate with cognitive testing;
  1. aged between 50 and 90 years;
  1. no clinical history of stroke or other severe cerebrovascular disease;
  1. no more than one lacunar infarction, without patchy or diffuse leukoaraiosis, on neuroradiological assessment of conventional MR images. 

* The exclusion criteria included:
  1. severe general medical disorders of cardiovascular, endocrine, renal or hepatic systems; neurological disorders associated with potential cognitive dysfunction, including local brain lesions, traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness or confusion, and dementia associated with neurosyphilis, Parkinsonism or Lewy body disease; psychiatric disorders including depression, alcohol or drug abuse;
  2. concomitant use of psychotropic medication in large quantity;
  3. insufficient cognitive capacity to understand and cooperate with study procedures.

* All patients underwent a complete physical and neurological examination, an extensive battery of neuropsychological assessments, and standard laboratory tests. Healthy volunteers underwent a brief clinical interview and MMSE to confirm they satisfied exclusion criteria for cognitive deficits, psychoactive drug use, and clinical disorders.
