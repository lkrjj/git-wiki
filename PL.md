* This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of PLA General Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from each enrolled subject or his/her authorized guardian. All of the participants were recruited by an advertisement ([http://www.301ad.com.cn](http://www.301ad.com.cn), Chinese version). Written consent forms were obtained from all of the subjects or their legal guardians under protocols approved by the ethics committee of the Chinese PLA General Hospital. Prior to selection for this study, all of the participants were given free physical, psychological and laboratory examinations. And all patients received professional suggestions for further treatment.

* All of the subjects were right-handed and underwent a battery of neuropsychological tests, including the MMSE, AVLT, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (<a href="/references/ref#ref1">Yesavage</a> et al., 1982), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) (<a href="/references/ref#ref2">Morris</a>, 1993) and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale. In brief, the AVLT consisted of 1 learning trial in which a list of 10 Chinese double-character words was read, and the subject was asked to immediately recall as many items as possible. The trial was repeated twice, and the immediate recall score was the average of 3 accurate recalls. After a 5-minute delay, each subject was asked to recall the words from the initial list (AVLT-delayed recall). The subjects were then told to identify the 10 studied words that were inter-mixed with 10 novel words (AVLT-recognition). 

* The recruited AD patients fulfilled the following inclusion criteria:
  1. diagnosed using the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer Diseaseâ€™s and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD;
  1. CDR = 1 or 2;
  1. currently receiving no nootropic drugs, such as cholinesterase inhibitors;
  1. able to perform the neuropsychological test and tolerate MR scanning. 

* The diagnostic criteria for MCI were determined as previously described (<a href="/references/ref#ref3">Petersen</a> et al., 1999) and included the following: 
  1. memory complaints lasting at least 6 months;
  1. CDR = 0.5;
  1. intact functional status and ADL < 26;
  1. lack of dementia.

* The criteria for NC included the following:
  1. normal physical status;
  1. CDR = 0;
  1. without memory complaints. 

* Exclusion conditions for participants of this study included the following:
  1. metabolic conditions such as hypothyroidism or vitamin B12/folic acid deficiencies;
  1. psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or depression;
  1. infarction or brain hemorrhaging, as indicated by MR/CT imaging;
  1. Parkinsonian syndrome, epilepsy and other nervous system diseases that can influence cognitive function.

* In addition, patients with a metallic foreign body, such as a cochlear implant, heart stent or other relevant MR scanning contraindications, were excluded from the study.
