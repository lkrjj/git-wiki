* The study was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee and Institutional Review Board of XuanWu Hospital (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02353884 and NCT02225964). Part of the data have been used in several previous studies, and detail information can be found elsewhere(<a href="https://github.com/YongLiuLab/MCADI/wiki/ref#ref22">Li</a> et al., 2014, <a href="https://github.com/YongLiuLab/MCADI/wiki/ref#ref23">Yan</a> et al., 2018).

* All subjects underwent a series of standardized clinical evaluations, including a medical history interview, a neurologic examination, and a battery of neuropsychological tests. Neuropsychological tests included the Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Beijing version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (<a href="https://github.com/YongLiuLab/MCADI/wiki/ref#ref24">Lu</a> et al., 2011)[29], the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR)(<a href="https://github.com/YongLiuLab/MCADI/wiki/ref#ref2">Morris</a>, 1993), the auditory verbal learning test (AVLT)(<a href="https://github.com/YongLiuLab/MCADI/wiki/ref#ref25">Guo</a> et al., 2007), an activities of daily living (ADL) assessment, the Hachinski Ischemic Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) (<a href="https://github.com/YongLiuLab/MCADI/wiki/ref#ref26">Hamilton</a>, 1960), and The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale(<a href="https://github.com/YongLiuLab/MCADI/wiki/ref#ref27">Dozeman</a> et al., 2011). Confirmation of diagnosis for all subjects was made by the consensus of at least two experienced neurologists in the Neurology Department of Xuan Wu Hospital. The diagnoses were based on the available data from the neuropsychological assessment evaluation, a battery of general neurological examinations, collateral and subject symptoms as well as functional capacity reports.

* Inclusion criteria for aMCI diagnosis included the following:
  1. memory complaints, confirmed by an informant;
  1. objectively impaired memory confirmed by neuropsychological tests;
  1. a definite history of cognitive decline;
  1. not meeting the criteria for dementia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Revised (DSM-IV-R);
  1. a CDR score of 0.5.

* AD subjects were diagnosed according to the National Institute of Aging-Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) criteria for clinically probable AD (<a href="https://github.com/YongLiuLab/MCADI/wiki/ref#ref14">McKhann</a> et al., 1984):
  1. meeting the criteria for dementia;
  1. insidious and gradual onset (not sudden) over more than 6 months;
  1. definite history of declining cognition;
  1. initial and most prominent cognitive deficits evident in amnestic or non-amnestic performance;
  1. hippocampal atrophy confirmed by structural MRI. 

* The NC patients were required to meet the following research criteria:
  1. no memory concerns;
  1. MMSE and MoCA scores within the normal range (adjusted for age, sex, and education);
  1. a CDR score of 0.

* The exclusion criteria applied to all subjects and a history of stroke included the following:
  1. vascular cognitive impairment (Hachinski Ischemic Scale score > 4 points);
  1. severe depression (HAMD score > 24 points or The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale score > 21 points);
  1. other central nervous system diseases that could cause cognitive decline (e.g., epilepsy, brain tumors, Parkinson’s disease, or encephalitis);
  1. systemic diseases that could cause cognitive impairments (e.g., anthracemia, syphilis, thyroid dysfunctions, severe anemia, or HIV);
  1. a history of psychosis or congenital mental growth retardation;
  1. severe hypopsia or dysacusis;
  1. cognitive decline caused by traumatic brain injury;
  1. severe end-stage disease or severe diseases in acute stages;
  1. unable to complete neuropsychological tests or with a contraindication for MRI.
